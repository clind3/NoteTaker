  ## Description

  The notetaker application allows the user to quickly add or delete notes necessary for daily tasks or work assignments. This application utilizes Express.js and Node.js and is deployed by <a href=’https://www.heroku.com/’>Heroku</a>. 
  
  From programming this application I learned the basic necessities of backend files. Utilizing GET, POST, and DELETE requests through routes while also being able to create and deploy a server.
